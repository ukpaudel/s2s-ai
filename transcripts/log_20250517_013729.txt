[Transcript] User:  I'm not sure I would like to eat some spicy food.
[Thinking] Calling LLM...
[Response] Assistant: Spicy food can definitely add some flavor to your meal, but it might not be the best choice if you're dealing with a headache. Sometimes, spicy foods can actually trigger or worsen headaches for some people. If you're looking for something to eat, maybe something mild would be better? How about some soup or a light snack? Let me know what you're in the mood for, and I can help you brainstorm some options!
