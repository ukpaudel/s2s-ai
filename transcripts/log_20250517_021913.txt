[Response] Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with an itchy throat! It can be really uncomfortable. Here are a few things you might consider trying:

1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to keep your throat moist. Herbal teas with honey can be especially soothing.

2. **Gargle Salt Water**: Mixing a teaspoon of salt in warm water and gargling it can help reduce irritation.

3. **Use Humidifiers**: If the air in your home is dry, a humidifier can add moisture to the air, which might help soothe your throat.

4. **Lozenges or Hard Candy**: Sucking on throat lozenges or hard candy can help keep your throat lubricated.

5. **Avoid Irritants**: Try to stay away from smoke, strong odors, and allergens that could be contributing to the itchiness.

6. **Over-the-Counter Remedies**: Antihistamines can help if your itchy throat is due to allergies.

If your symptoms persist or worsen, it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional. How long have you been experiencing this?
