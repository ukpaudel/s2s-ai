[Thinking] Calling LLM...
[Response] Assistant: Thanks for the info! A blinking green light usually indicates that there’s some activity, but it can also mean that there’s a connection problem. Here are a few steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Restart Your Router**: Unplug your router, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. This can often resolve connectivity issues.

2. **Check Your Cables**: Make sure all cables are securely connected. Sometimes, a loose cable can cause connection problems.

3. **Look for Outages**: Check with your internet service provider to see if there's a known outage in your area. You can usually do this on their website or by calling them.

4. **Connect via Ethernet**: If you have an Ethernet cable, try connecting your device directly to the router. This can help you determine if the issue is with your Wi-Fi.

5. **Device Settings**: Check the Wi-Fi settings on your device to ensure that Wi-Fi is turned on and that you’re connected to the correct network.

Let me know how it goes, and if you need more help, I’m here for you!
