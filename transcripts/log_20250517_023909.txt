[Response] Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with a headache. First, try to find a quiet, dark place to relax. Sometimes resting can help. Make sure you're hydrated, too, as dehydration can make headaches worse. If you have any over-the-counter pain relief, that might help as well. Taking deep breaths and gently massaging your temples can also ease the discomfort. How long have you been feeling this way?
