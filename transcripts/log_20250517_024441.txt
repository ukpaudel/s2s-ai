[Response] Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a headache. First, try to find a quiet, dark space to relax. Sometimes, closing your eyes and taking deep breaths can help ease the pain. Staying hydrated is also important, so drink some water if you can. If you're comfortable with it, consider taking over-the-counter pain relief, following the instructions on the label. If your headache persists or gets worse, it might be a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional. Take care and I hope you feel better soon.
