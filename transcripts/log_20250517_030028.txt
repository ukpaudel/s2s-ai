[Response] Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. First, try to find a quiet, dark place to rest. Drinking plenty of water can also help. If you can, take some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Make sure to avoid any bright screens and take a break. If it doesn't improve soon, it might be a good idea to check in with a doctor.
